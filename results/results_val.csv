The candidate report is brief and does not mention any comparison to a prior examination. It only states that the cardiac contours are within normal limits.

The candidate report is missing a significant finding that was present in the reference report. The reference report mentions ""Prior granulomatous disease appears stable"", which is not mentioned in the candidate report.

The candidate report states ""heart size within normal limits"", which contradicts the reference report's finding of cardiomegaly.

(a) False report of a finding in the candidate: 2. Low lung volumes; No focal airspace consolidation.
(b) Missing a finding present in the reference: 2. Increased interstitial opacities; Cardiomegaly.
